Software installation procedures: things I did to get code working

For qCMOS connection
--------------------------------
1. Download DCAM-API Lite for Linux
2. Unpack tarball; navigate to DCAM-API_Lite_for_Linux/api. Run "bash install.sh usb3 fbd"
3.

For ZWO filter wheel connection
--------------------------------
1. Downloaded PyZWOEFW GitHub repo by Andre Ebel: https://github.com/AndreEbel/PyZWOEFW/tree/main
2. Moved folder to LIGHTSPEED-CONTROL repo
3. Navigated to LIGHTSPEED-CONTROL folder. Ran "pip install -e PyZWOEFW-main"
4. Ran "pip install PyQt5"
5. Downloaded ZWO EFW SDK from https://www.zwoastro.com/software/. Located and unpacked tarball EFW_Linux_macOS_SDK_V1.7.tar.bz2
6. Deleted original (Windows SDK file)
7. Copied .so.1.7 file to examples
8. Commented out "self.SetPosition(ID, 0)" in pyzwoefw.py (not sure why this worked, but it fixed an error)
9. In pyzwoefw.py, added line
efwlib = c.cdll.LoadLibrary('/home/lightspeed/Documents/Lightspeed-Control/PyZWOEFW-main/examples/libEFWFilter.so.1.7')
after importing os and defining file directory.
10. Added "ctypes.CDLL("libudev.so.1", mode=ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL)" to header of control file
11. Ran "sudo install efw.rules /lib/udev/rules.d" to be able to connect to filter wheel without needing root privileges
12. Restarted computer

Some notes
--------------------------------
1. At present, the camera is recognized only via USB3. Still working on connecting via CoaXpress.
2. Since a GPS card is not installed yet on the main control PC, I commented out "import GPS_time"
from GUI.py and test.py, as it was raising an error for not being able to find libmbgdevio.so
