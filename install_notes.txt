Software installation procedures: things I did to get code working

For qCMOS connection
--------------------------------
1. Download DCAM-API Lite for Linux
2. Unpack tarball; navigate to DCAM-API_Lite_for_Linux/api. Run "bash install.sh usb3 fbd"
3.

For ZWO filter wheel connection
--------------------------------
1. Downloaded PyZWOEFW GitHub repo by Andre Ebel: https://github.com/AndreEbel/PyZWOEFW/tree/main
2. Moved folder to LIGHTSPEED-CONTROL repo
3. Navigated to LIGHTSPEED-CONTROL folder. Ran "pip install -e PyZWOEFW-main"
4. Ran "pip install PyQt5"
5. Downloaded ZWO EFW SDK from https://www.zwoastro.com/software/. Located and unpacked tarball EFW_Linux_macOS_SDK_V1.7.tar.bz2
6. Deleted original (Windows SDK file)
7. Copied .so.1.7 file to examples
8. Commented out "self.SetPosition(ID, 0)" in pyzwoefw.py (not sure why this worked, but it fixed an error)
9. In pyzwoefw.py, added line
efwlib = c.cdll.LoadLibrary('/home/lightspeed/Documents/Lightspeed-Control/PyZWOEFW-main/examples/libEFWFilter.so.1.7')
after importing os and defining file directory.
10. Added "ctypes.CDLL("libudev.so.1", mode=ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL)" to header of control file
11. Ran "sudo install efw.rules /lib/udev/rules.d" to be able to connect to filter wheel without needing root privileges
12. Restarted computer

For SESTO SENSO 2 connection
--------------------------------
1. Downloaded virt-manager, created Windows 10 VM
2. Connected both SESTO SENSO 2 focusers to power, ARCO, and USB ports.
3. Opened VM, clicked blue "Information" button. Ensured there were 3 USB redirectors. Created 2 serial connections, with device type "unix"
and paths "/dev/ttyUSB0" and "/dev/ttyUSB1"
4. Above blue "Information" button, clicked "Virtual Machine" -> "Redirect USB Device" and select both Silicon Labs CP2102N devices.
Sometimes these get unchecked when the focusers get disconnected/unplugged.
All of the following in Windows VM:
5. Installed PLAY (Prima Luce AstrophotographY software), ASCOM 7.0, and SESTO SENSO 2 drivers.
6. Checked in Device Manager that both Silicon Labs is showing up on COM port
7. For each focuser/ARCO: opened PLAY. Connected to COM port corresponding to focuser. Updated firmware. Calibrated SESTO SENSO 2. Calibrated ARCO.
Also used PLAY to set to Dark Mode, which turns off LEDs on the SESTO SENSO 2 focusers (have to click arrow in bottom right corner to get to this option).
8. Made python script with ASCOM. A commented out section of this script opened the ASCOM Chooser. Through this Chooser, I selected PLL ASCOM Rotator,
selected properties, and made sure this device connects to COM3. I then selected PLL ASCOM Rotator 2, selected properties, and linked this to COM4.
9. Made ascom_rotators.py script in Documents of Windows VM that can be run to change the absolute positions of the rotators.
To start virtual machine, open a command prompt. Type "virt-manager". Select the win10 machine, hit Open, and press the play button. PW is the same as
for Lightspeed control PC. Each time may need to repeat "redirect USB device"

For CyberPower PDU41003 Control
--------------------------------
1. Downloaded Jack Haviland's PDU control code (GUI doesn't work, but rest does).
2. Navigated to python-cyberpower-pdu. Ran "pip install -e ."

For Lab Jack Shutter Control
--------------------------------
1. Downloaded LJM software for Linux: https://support.labjack.com/docs/ljm-software-installer-downloads-t4-t7-t8-digit
2. Unzipped file, navigated to its folder and ran "sudo ./labjack_ljm_installer.run"

For Zaber Stage Control
--------------------------------
1. Just ran "pip install zaber-motion"
